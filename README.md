# Chef GPT

This project aims to demonstrate the use of a customized AI chef, endowed with a unique personality, based on OpenAI's API. 
Each chef will have their own personality and specialty, and they will respond to three types of inputs:
  - suggesting dishes based on ingredients
  - giving recipes to dishes
  - criticizing the recipes given by the user input

# Prerequisites

  - OpenAI API Key
  - Python 3.7 or later version
  - Virtual environment

# Usage
```python
python -r install requirements.txt
python main.py
```
You must choose the chef that you want to use.
```python

Then you will be ask to choose the prompt you want: 

```python
